##Powerball Calcualtor
This is a calculator built in about 2 hours after submitting $10 to our office Powerball pool at [Blue Rooster](http://bluerooster)
Also included is `convertformat.html` that contains the code needed to convert `.csv` output from excel into a nested array suitable for consumption by the methods in `/js/lotto.js`
###Enhancements that could be made
* Provide a way to enter your numbers into the table
* Find a way to pull live Powerball results (api,twitter?)
* Track individual contributions/payouts
* Historical Results (found in plaintext at the powerball site
